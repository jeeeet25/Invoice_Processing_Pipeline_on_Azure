# Invoice Processing Pipeline on Azure  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end invoice processing pipeline** built on **Azure cloud services**, designed to automate ingestion, transformation, and reporting of financial invoice data.  

The pipeline uses **Power Automate, SharePoint, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2), Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI** to build a robust **ETL/ELT architecture** with Bronze–Silver–Gold layers, real-time triggers, and business-ready dashboards.

## 🎯 Business Problem  
Finance and procurement teams often face challenges in **managing vendor invoices**:  
- Manual processing is slow and error-prone.  
- Invoices arrive in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel).  
- Lack of central visibility on vendor spend, overdue payments, and SLAs.  

This pipeline automates the **end-to-end lifecycle**: from receiving invoices in email to delivering validated, aggregated, and analytics-ready data for decision-making.

## 🔹 End-to-End Data Flow  

1. **Invoice Arrival (Source)**  
   - Vendors send invoices via email.  
   - Power Automate monitors Outlook → saves attachments to **SharePoint**.  

2. **Staging in SharePoint**  
   - Invoices centralized in an **Incoming Invoices folder**.  
   - Optional: consolidate multiple attachments into a single batch file.  

3. **Raw Zone – ADLS Gen2**  
   - Power Automate/Event Grid copies new files to **ADLS Gen2 Raw container**.  
   - Metadata (file name, size, source, timestamp) logged into **Azure SQL/Log Analytics**.  

4. **Cleansing & Structuring – Silver Zone**  
   - **Azure Data Factory** / **Databricks Autoloader** parses files.  
   - Schema normalization (invoice_id, vendor_id, amount, due_date, etc.).  
   - Deduplication, error handling, and validation.  
   - Cleansed data stored in **Parquet/Delta** format in Silver zone.  

5. **Business Transformations – Gold Zone**  
   - Aggregations: monthly spend, vendor totals, payment aging.  
   - Joins with **vendor master data** from SQL/ERP.  
   - Outputs business-ready datasets in Gold zone + **Synapse SQL Pool**.  

6. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - **Power BI** dashboards for Finance & Procurement:  
     - Spend analysis  
     - On-time vs overdue payments  
     - Forecast trends  

7. **Automation & Monitoring**  
   - **Event Grid** triggers pipelines on file arrival.  
   - **Logic Apps / Power Automate** send alerts for failed loads or SLA breaches.  
   - **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics** track pipeline health & performance.  

8. **Optional Add-Ons**  
   - **OCR with Form Recognizer** → parse unstructured PDF invoices.  
   - **Purview** for data catalog & lineage tracking.  
   - **Key Vault** for secrets management.  
   - **Databricks ML** for predicting late payments.
